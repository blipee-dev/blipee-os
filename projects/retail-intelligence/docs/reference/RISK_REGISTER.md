## Risk Response Strategies

### Critical Risks (Immediate Action Required)
1. **O1 - Data Quality Issues**
   - Week 1: Implement comprehensive validation
   - Week 2: Deploy quality monitoring dashboard
   - Week 3: Create automated alerting system

### High Risks (Plan Required)
1. **T1 - Sensor Integration Complexity**
   - Create generic adapter interface
   - Start with most common sensors
   - Build simulation environment

2. **B1 - Customer Adoption**
   - Develop compelling pilot program
   - Create success metrics dashboard
   - Build reference architecture

### Risk Monitoring Plan

**Weekly Reviews**
- Technical risks with development team
- Resource risks with project management
- Testing results and quality metrics

**Bi-weekly Reviews**
- Business risks with leadership
- Budget and timeline status
- Customer feedback from pilots

**Monthly Reviews**
- Full risk register review
- Update mitigation strategies
- Board reporting

## Escalation Triggers

| Risk Level | Trigger Conditions | Escalation Path |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Critical | - Any critical risk becomes active<br>- Multiple high risks active<br>- Budget overrun >20% | CEO + Board |
| High | - High risk mitigation failing<br>- Timeline slip >2 weeks<br>- Key resource unavailable | Executive Team |
| Medium | - Medium risks increasing<br>- Minor timeline impacts<br>- Quality concerns | Project Steering Committee |

## Risk Budget

**Financial Contingency**: 20% of project budget
**Timeline Buffer**: 2 weeks per phase
**Resource Buffer**: 1 additional developer, 0.5 QA

## Success Criteria for Risk Closure

A risk can be marked as closed when:
1. Mitigation strategy fully implemented
2. Risk has not materialized for 2 sprints
3. Acceptance criteria met
4. Sign-off from risk owner
