## Key Advantages of This Approach

### 1. Speed to Market
- **6 weeks** vs 12 weeks (50% faster)
- **2-3 developers** vs 4-6 (more efficient)
- **Immediate AI access** vs building from scratch

### 2. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
```typescript
// Retail module instantly gets:
- Multi-tenant authentication
- AI agents (ESG Chief, Compliance Guardian)
- ML pipeline with AutoML
- Monitoring & analytics
- WebSocket support
- API rate limiting
- Compliance features
```

### 3. Network Effects
- Retail data enhances ESG predictions
- ESG compliance affects retail operations
- Shared customer insights across modules
- Unified reporting and analytics

### 4. Migration Path
When to consider monorepo (future):
- Build times > 10 minutes (currently ~2 min)
- Team > 50 engineers (currently ~10)
- Need independent deployments
- Module conflicts become frequent
