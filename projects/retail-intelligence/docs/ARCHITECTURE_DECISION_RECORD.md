# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR-001: Enhanced Modular Architecture

**Date**: January 12, 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context

The retail intelligence platform needs to be integrated into the existing Blipee-OS platform. We evaluated three architectural approaches:

1. **Current Modular Approach** - Module within Blipee-OS
2. **Full Monorepo Structure** - Separate apps and packages
3. **Hybrid Approach** - Gradual migration path

### Decision

We will use the **Enhanced Modular Architecture** - implementing the retail intelligence platform as a module within the existing Blipee-OS platform.

### Rationale

#### Business Drivers
- **Time to Market**: 6 weeks vs 4-6 months with monorepo
- **Cost Efficiency**: 2-3 developers vs 4-6 developers
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proven architecture already in production
- **Customer Value**: Immediate access to all AI capabilities

#### Technical Benefits
1. **Shared Infrastructure**
   - Authentication/RBAC already implemented
   - AI agents and ML pipeline ready to use
   - Monitoring and analytics in place
   - Compliance features built-in

2. **Network Effects**
   - Retail data enhances ESG predictions
   - ESG insights improve retail operations
   - Unified customer view across domains
   - Shared learning across modules

3. **Development Velocity**
   - No infrastructure setup required
   - Immediate access to 50+ existing features
   - Single deployment pipeline
   - Unified testing framework

4. **Operational Simplicity**
   - Single codebase to maintain
   - One deployment process
   - Unified monitoring/logging
   - Consistent user experience

### Consequences

#### Positive
- ✅ 10x faster feature delivery
- ✅ Immediate AI/ML capabilities
- ✅ Lower operational overhead
- ✅ Better cross-domain insights
- ✅ Reduced complexity
- ✅ Faster onboarding for developers

#### Negative
- ❌ Cannot scale modules independently
- ❌ All modules deploy together
- ❌ Shared build times
- ❌ Potential for cross-module bugs

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Module Isolation**: Clear boundaries and interfaces
2. **Feature Flags**: Control rollout independently
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track module-specific metrics
4. **Migration Path**: Clear criteria for future monorepo

### Migration Triggers

We will reconsider this decision and potentially migrate to monorepo when:

- Build times exceed 10 minutes
- Team size exceeds 50 engineers
- Deploy conflicts occur > 3x per week
- Module coupling causes > 5 incidents/month
- Independent scaling becomes critical

### Alternatives Considered

#### Monorepo Architecture
- **Pros**: Better separation, independent scaling, clear boundaries
- **Cons**: 4-6 months implementation, higher complexity, more developers needed
- **Rejected because**: Time to market is critical for competitive advantage

#### Hybrid Approach
- **Pros**: Gradual migration, lower risk
- **Cons**: Technical debt, confusion, half measures
- **Rejected because**: Doesn't solve core problems, adds complexity

### Review Date

This decision will be reviewed:
- After 6 months in production
- When team size doubles
- If performance issues emerge
- At $10M ARR milestone
