## Option 3: Slack-Only Tracking

### Create Channels:
```
#transform-daily (for updates)

```

### Daily Update Format:
```
ðŸ“… 2024-03-28 Update

3. ðŸŸ¢=on track, ðŸŸ¡=at risk, ðŸ”´=blocked
4. Tag @team-lead for blockers >2hrs
```

---

## Option 4: Minimal CLI Tracking

Create `track.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
echo "=== Daily Update for $DATE ==="
read -p "Task ID: " TASK
read -p "Progress today: " PROGRESS
read -p "Any blockers? " BLOCKERS
read -p "Status (G/Y/R): " STATUS

echo "$DATE|$TASK|$PROGRESS|$BLOCKERS|$STATUS" >> tracking.csv
echo "âœ… Update logged!"
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Bare Minimum Tracking

If you do NOTHING else, track these 5 things daily:

### The Daily Five
1. **What task are you on?** (ID)
2. **What did you finish today?** (Progress)
3. **What's blocking you?** (Blockers)
4. **Are you on track?** (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´)
5. **What's next?** (Tomorrow)

### Text File Version
Create `tracker.txt`:
```
=== WEEK 0 ===
Mon 3/28: Task 0.1 | Started patches | No blocks | ðŸŸ¢ | Continue tomorrow
Tue 3/29: Task 0.1 | Patches done | Testing slow | ðŸŸ¡ | Start 0.2
Wed 3/30: Task 0.2 | Backup configured | None | ðŸŸ¢ | Test restore
```
