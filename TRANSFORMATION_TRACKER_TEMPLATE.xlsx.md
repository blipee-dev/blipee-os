# Excel Tracker Template Structure

Since I cannot create actual Excel files, here's the detailed structure for your transformation tracker spreadsheet. Create this in Google Sheets or Excel:

## üóÇÔ∏è Spreadsheet Structure

### Sheet 1: Executive Dashboard
```
A1: blipee OS Transformation Tracker
A2: Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]
A3: Overall Progress: [FORMULA: Completed Tasks / Total Tasks]

```

### Sheet 4: Blocker Log
```
Headers:
| Blocker ID | Date Identified | Task ID | Description | Owner | Escalated? | Escalated To | Resolution | Date Resolved | Hours Blocked |

Example:

```

### Sheet 5: Resource Tracker

```

### Sheet 7: Risk Register
```

Risk Matrix:
| | Low Impact | Med Impact | High Impact |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|

```

### Sheet 9: Meeting Minutes
```

```

### Sheet 10: Metrics & Charts
```
Create these charts:
1. Burndown Chart (Tasks remaining over time)
2. Budget Burn Rate
3. Blocker Age Distribution  
4. Phase Progress Bars
5. Resource Utilization
6. Risk Heat Map
```

## üìä Key Formulas to Include

### Overall Progress
```excel
=COUNTIF(TaskMaster!H:H,"COMPLETED")/COUNTA(TaskMaster!H:H)
```

### Days Remaining
```excel
=NETWORKDAYS(TODAY(),EndDate)
```

### Budget Remaining
```excel
=Budget-Spent
```

### Health Status (Conditional Formatting)
```excel
=IF(Progress<ExpectedProgress*0.9,"üî¥",IF(Progress<ExpectedProgress,"üü°","üü¢"))
```

### Blocker Age
```excel
=IF(ISBLANK(DateResolved),TODAY()-DateIdentified,DateResolved-DateIdentified)
```

## üé® Conditional Formatting Rules

1. **Status Colors**:
   - COMPLETED = Green
   - IN_PROGRESS = Yellow
   - BLOCKED = Red
   - NOT_STARTED = Gray

2. **Date Highlighting**:
   - Overdue = Red background
   - Due Today = Yellow background
   - Due This Week = Light yellow

3. **Budget Alerts**:
   - >90% used = Red
   - >75% used = Yellow
   - <75% = Green

4. **Blocker Age**:
   - >48 hours = Red
   - >24 hours = Yellow
   - <24 hours = Green

## üîß Automation Ideas

### Google Sheets Scripts
```javascript
// Auto-update timestamp
function onEdit(e) {
  var sheet = e.source.getActiveSheet();
  var cell = e.range;
  
  if (sheet.getName() == "Daily Updates" && cell.getColumn() <= 9) {
    var timestampCell = sheet.getRange(1, 2);
    timestampCell.setValue(new Date());
  }
}

// Send daily reminder
function sendDailyReminder() {
  var blockers = getActiveBlockers();
  if (blockers.length > 0) {
    MailApp.sendEmail({
      to: "team@blipee.com",
      subject: "Daily Update Reminder - " + blockers.length + " blockers",
      body: "Please update your tasks. Current blockers: " + blockers.join(", ")
    });
  }
}
```

## üì± Mobile-Friendly View

Create a simplified sheet for mobile updates:
```
Sheet: Mobile Update
| Task | Status | Today's Update | Blockers? |
|------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| [Dropdown] | [Dropdown] | [Text] | [Y/N] |
[Submit Button - runs script to copy to main sheet]
```

## üîó Data Validation Rules

1. **Status**: Dropdown with values:
   - NOT_STARTED
   - IN_PROGRESS
   - IN_REVIEW
   - IN_TESTING
   - COMPLETED
   - BLOCKED
   - ROLLED_BACK

2. **Priority**: Dropdown with:
   - CRITICAL
   - HIGH
   - MEDIUM
   - LOW

3. **Confidence**: Dropdown with:
   - üü¢ GREEN
   - üü° YELLOW
   - üî¥ RED

4. **Dates**: Must be weekdays only
5. **Progress**: 0-100 only
6. **Hours**: Positive numbers only

## üì§ Import/Export Templates

### CSV Import Format
```csv
TaskID,Phase,TaskName,Duration,Owner,Status,Progress
0.1,0,Security Patches,2,John Doe,NOT_STARTED,0
```

### Status Report Export
Create a "Generate Report" button that exports:
- Executive summary
- Phase status
- Active blockers
- This week's accomplishments
- Next week's plan

This structure provides comprehensive tracking while remaining manageable. Start with the Executive Dashboard and Task Master List, then add other sheets as needed.
