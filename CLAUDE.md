## Architecture Overview

### AI System Architecture

The AI system (`/src/lib/ai/`) follows a multi-provider pattern with intelligent orchestration:

1. **Provider Abstraction** (`service.ts`): Seamlessly switches between AI providers based on availability and performance
2. **Context Engine** (`context-engine.ts`): Builds rich context from building data, user history, and external sources
3. **Action Planner** (`action-planner.ts`): Generates step-by-step plans for complex sustainability goals
4. **Sustainability Intelligence** (`sustainability-intelligence.ts`): 12 capability interfaces for comprehensive sustainability analysis
5. **Document Parser** (`/src/lib/data/document-parser.ts`): Extracts emissions data from PDFs, images, and spreadsheets using OCR and AI
6. **Industry Intelligence** (`/src/lib/ai/industry-intelligence/`): Advanced GRI sector standards with cross-industry insights, regulatory intelligence, and automated compliance

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Organizations contain multiple buildings
- 5 role levels: account_owner, sustainability_manager, facility_manager, analyst, viewer
- PostgreSQL Row Level Security ensures data isolation
- Team invitation system with granular permissions

### Conversation Flow

1. User message → `ConversationInterface.tsx`
2. API call → `/api/ai/chat/route.ts`
3. Context building → AI service selection → Response generation
4. Dynamic UI components rendered based on response
5. Message persistence in Supabase

### External Data Integration

- **Weather**: OpenWeatherMap API for real-time conditions
- **Carbon Data**: Electricity Maps, Climatiq, Carbon Interface
- **Document Processing**: Automatic emission extraction from invoices, utility bills, travel documents

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Autonomous AI Agents**: Not just conversational UI, but autonomous agents that work 24/7 making decisions and taking actions within approved parameters

2. **No Dashboards Philosophy**: Everything is conversational. The AI generates visualizations dynamically based on context rather than pre-built dashboards

3. **Multi-Brain Orchestration**: Intelligent routing to the best AI model for each task type with automatic fallback for 99.99% uptime

4. **ML-Powered Predictions**: Every interaction trains models that predict emissions, compliance risks, and optimization opportunities

5. **GRI Sector Standards**: Deep integration with GRI 11-17 standards for industry-specific compliance and reporting

6. **Network Effects**: Each customer's anonymized data improves the platform for all users

7. **Zero Setup**: Full value in 5 minutes through AI that auto-discovers and configures everything
