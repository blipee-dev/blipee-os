-- Populate Energy Metric Targets based on 2023 Baseline Data
-- This creates metric-level targets for ALL energy categories using:
-- - 2023 baseline emissions
-- - Category-level SBTi reduction rates
-- - 2025 as target year (2 years cumulative reduction)
--
-- This script is designed to work for ANY organization with energy metrics
--
-- Category Reduction Rates (SBTi 1.5Â°C pathway):
-- - Electricity: 5.2% annual = 10.4% cumulative (2 years)
-- - Purchased Energy: 4.2% annual = 8.4% cumulative
-- - Purchased Heating: 4.2% annual = 8.4% cumulative
-- - Purchased Cooling: 4.2% annual = 8.4% cumulative
-- - Purchased Steam: 4.2% annual = 8.4% cumulative
-- - Stationary Combustion (Natural Gas, Heating Oil, etc.): 4.2% annual = 8.4% cumulative
-- - Mobile Combustion (Diesel, Gasoline, etc.): 4.2% annual = 8.4% cumulative
