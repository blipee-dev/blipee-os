# ✅ Ready for Railway Deployment

Your Blipee AI Agent Worker is **100% ready** to deploy to Railway!

## 📦 What's Been Prepared

### 1. Docker Configuration
- ✅ **Dockerfile.worker** - Optimized multi-stage build
  - Node.js 20 Alpine base
  - Security: Non-root user (worker:nodejs)
  - Health check endpoint included
  - Production-ready

- ✅ **.dockerignore** - Optimized build
  - Excludes node_modules, .next, .git
  - Smaller image size
  - Faster builds

### 2. Railway Configuration
- ✅ **railway.json** - Deployment config
  - Uses Dockerfile builder
  - Auto-restart on failure (max 10 retries)
  - Health check on /health endpoint
  - 300s timeout for startup

### 3. Agent Worker
- ✅ **src/workers/agent-worker.ts** - Background process
  - ✨ **NEW**: HTTP health check server on port 8080
  - Returns JSON: `{ status, uptime, organizations, agents, timestamp }`
  - Auto-initializes agents for all organizations
  - Real-time task result listening
  - Proactive message generation
  - Self-healing (restarts on failure)
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### 4. Database
- ✅ **supabase/migrations/20251026040000_agent_proactive_messaging.sql**
  - Notifications table
  - Agent scheduled tasks
  - Message enhancements (agent_id, priority)
  - Ready to apply

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Step-by-step guide
- ✅ **AGENTS_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - Full implementation docs
- ✅ **docs/AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - General deployment guide

## 🚀 Deploy Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
```bash
# Login
railway login

# Initialize
railway init

# Set environment variables
railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
railway variables set SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production

# Deploy!
railway up
```

### Step 3: Verify
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

## 🏥 Health Check Endpoint

The worker now exposes `/health` on port 8080:

**Request:**
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "organizations": 1,
  "agents": 8,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-26T15:30:00.000Z"
}
```
