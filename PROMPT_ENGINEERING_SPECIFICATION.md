## 🧪 PROMPT TESTING & OPTIMIZATION

### A/B Testing Framework
```typescript
class PromptOptimizer {
  // Test prompt variants
  async runABTest(
    basePrompt: string,
    variants: string[],

            this.executePrompt(variant, testCase.input)
          )
        );

        return this.evaluateResponses(responses, testCase.expectedOutput, metrics);
      })
    );

    return this.analyzeTestResults(results);
  }

  // Quality metrics for evaluation
  private evaluateResponseQuality(

      breakdown: scores,
      feedback: this.generateFeedback(scores)
    };
  }

  // Genetic algorithm for prompt evolution

    performance: PerformanceData,
    generations: number = 10
  ): Promise<OptimizedPrompt> {

    let currentGeneration = this.createInitialPopulation(basePrompt);

    for (let gen = 0; gen < generations; gen++) {
      // Evaluate fitness of each prompt variant
      const fitness = await this.evaluatePopulation(currentGeneration);

      // Select best performers for breeding
      const selected = this.selectForBreeding(currentGeneration, fitness);

          return { hasCorrectFactor, hasCorrectResult, citesSources };
        }
      }
    ]
  },

  // Test for appropriate uncertainty communication
  uncertaintyHandling: {
    testCases: [
      {

          const providesRange = /±|\+\/\-|range|between/i.test(response);
          const acknowledgesLimitations = /limited|incomplete|assumptions/i.test(response);
          return { expressesUncertainty, providesRange, acknowledgesLimitations };
        }
      }
    ]
  },

  // Test for actionable recommendations
  actionability: {
    testCases: [
      {
        input: "High energy consumption detected, what should we do?",
        expected: "Specific, measurable actions with timelines",
        validation: (response) => {
          const hasSpecificActions = /implement|install|replace|optimize/i.test(response);
          const hasTimelines = /days|weeks|months|by \d{4}/i.test(response);
          const hasMetrics = /reduce.*%|save.*kWh|target/i.test(response);
          return { hasSpecificActions, hasTimelines, hasMetrics };
        }
