# Dashboard Caching Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-10-15

## Server Status
✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3001
✅ No compilation errors in WaterDashboard.tsx
✅ No compilation errors in WasteDashboard.tsx

## Migration Verification

### WaterDashboard Migration
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/WaterDashboard.tsx`

**Changes Applied**:
1. ✅ Import added: `import { useWaterDashboard } from '@/hooks/useDashboardData';` (line 44)
2. ✅ Hook call added (lines 76-81):
   ```typescript
   const { sources, prevYearSources, forecast, isLoading } = useWaterDashboard(
     selectedPeriod || { start: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0], end: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0], label: 'Custom' },
     selectedSite,
     organizationId
   );
   ```
3. ✅ Large useEffect replaced with processing useEffect (lines 114-280)
4. ✅ Loading state replaced with `isLoading` from hook (line 283)

**Expected Behavior**:
- First visit: ~5s load time (must fetch from API)
- Return visit (<5 min): ~0.1s load time (served from cache)
- API calls reduced by 70-80%
- All queries run in parallel

### WasteDashboard Migration
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/WasteDashboard.tsx`

**Changes Applied**:
1. ✅ Import added: `import { useWasteDashboard } from '@/hooks/useDashboardData';` (line 30)
2. ✅ Hook call added (lines 75-79):
   ```typescript
   const { streams, prevYearStreams, forecast, baseline2023, metricTargets: metricTargetsQuery, isLoading } = useWasteDashboard(
     selectedPeriod || { start: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0], end: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0], label: 'Custom' },
     selectedSite,
     organizationId
   );
   ```
3. ✅ Three separate useEffect hooks replaced with ONE processing useEffect (lines 112-199)
4. ✅ Loading state replaced with `isLoading` from hook

**Expected Behavior**:
- First visit: ~5s load time (must fetch from API)
- Return visit (<5 min): ~0.1s load time (served from cache)
- API calls reduced by 70-80%
- All queries run in parallel
- Conditional fetching: baseline2023 and metricTargets only for current year

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Water Dashboard Tests
- [ ] Navigate to Water Dashboard (first visit)
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads correctly with all data
- [ ] Check browser DevTools Network tab for API calls
- [ ] Navigate away and return within 5 minutes
- [ ] Verify instant loading from cache (no API calls)
- [ ] Check React Query DevTools for cached queries
- [ ] Verify YoY comparison displays correctly
- [ ] Verify forecast data displays correctly
- [ ] Test with different site selections
- [ ] Test with different period selections

### Waste Dashboard Tests
- [ ] Navigate to Waste Dashboard (first visit)
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads correctly with all data
- [ ] Check browser DevTools Network tab for API calls
- [ ] Navigate away and return within 5 minutes
- [ ] Verify instant loading from cache (no API calls)
- [ ] Check React Query DevTools for cached queries
- [ ] Verify YoY comparison displays correctly
- [ ] Verify forecast data displays correctly
- [ ] Verify baseline 2023 data displays (current year only)
- [ ] Verify metric targets display correctly
- [ ] Test with different site selections
- [ ] Test with different period selections

### Performance Tests
- [ ] First visit load time: ~5s
- [ ] Cached visit load time: ~0.1s
- [ ] API call reduction: 70-80%
- [ ] Parallel query execution confirmed
- [ ] No redundant API calls on return visit
- [ ] Cache invalidation works after 5 minutes

## Expected Performance Metrics

### Before Migration (No Caching):
- Load time: ~5s per visit
- API calls: 3-5 per dashboard visit
- Bandwidth: ~500KB per visit
- Total for 10 visits: 50s waiting, ~5MB transferred

### After Migration (With Caching):
- First visit: ~5s
- Cached visits (<5 min): ~0.1s
- API calls: 1 initial + automatic refresh after 5 min
- Bandwidth: ~500KB initial + minimal on cached visits
- Total for 10 visits in 10 min: ~6s waiting, ~500KB transferred

**Improvement: 88% faster, 90% less bandwidth**

## React Query Configuration

Both hooks use the following caching configuration:

```typescript
{
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,      // 5 minutes - data is fresh
  gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,        // 10 minutes - keep in memory
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false,   // Don't refetch on tab focus
  refetchOnMount: false          // Don't refetch if data is fresh
}
```

## Notes

- The server compiled successfully with no errors related to the dashboard migrations
- The migration pattern matches the successful EnergyDashboard implementation
- All TypeScript types are properly inferred from the React Query hooks
- The processing useEffect depends only on cached data, not on fetching

## Next Steps

1. Manual testing with browser to verify functionality
2. Check React Query DevTools for cache behavior
3. Measure actual load times with Network tab
4. Update documentation with results
5. Create detailed migration docs (WATER_DASHBOARD_MIGRATION.md, WASTE_DASHBOARD_MIGRATION.md)

## Conclusion

**Migration Status**: Code changes complete ✅ | Runtime testing pending ⏳

The migration is complete from a code perspective. Both dashboards now use React Query hooks for intelligent caching and parallel data fetching. The pattern matches the successful EnergyDashboard migration. Manual testing is needed to verify the caching behavior works as expected in the browser.
