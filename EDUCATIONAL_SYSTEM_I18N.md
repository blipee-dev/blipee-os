# Educational System - I18n Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines how to implement the fully internationalized and context-aware educational system.

## Translation Keys Structure

Add these keys to `src/messages/en.json`, `pt.json`, and `es.json`:

## Portuguese (pt.json) - Sample

```json
{
  "education": {
    "topics": {
      "carbonBasics": {
        "title": "Compreender as EmissÃµes de Carbono",
        "sections": {
          "whatIsCO2e": {
            "heading": "O que Ã© CO2e?",
            "content": "CO2e (Equivalente de DiÃ³xido de Carbono) Ã© uma unidade padrÃ£o para medir pegadas de carbono. Expressa o impacto de diferentes gases de efeito estufa em termos da quantidade equivalente de CO2."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Spanish (es.json) - Sample

```json
{
  "education": {
    "topics": {
      "carbonBasics": {
        "title": "Comprender las Emisiones de Carbono",
        "sections": {
          "whatIsCO2e": {
            "heading": "Â¿QuÃ© es CO2e?",
            "content": "CO2e (Equivalente de DiÃ³xido de Carbono) es una unidad estÃ¡ndar para medir las huellas de carbono. Expresa el impacto de diferentes gases de efecto invernadero en tÃ©rminos de la cantidad equivalente de CO2."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Dynamic Context System

The system adapts based on:

### 1. **Location/Country** (from organization.country field)
- **Portugal**: Examples use Lisbon, Portuguese wildfires, wine regions
- **Spain**: Madrid, Barcelona water crisis, olive groves
- **USA**: LA to NYC, hurricanes, California fires
- **UK**: London, Thames flooding, Scottish agriculture
- **Global** (fallback): Generic international examples

### 2. **Industry Sector** (from organization.industry_sector / GRI 11-17)
- **Professional Services**: Virtual meetings, train travel, paperless
- **Manufacturing**: Energy efficiency, circular economy, process optimization
- **Retail**: LED lighting, refrigeration, sustainable packaging
- **General** (fallback): Universal strategies

### 3. **User Language** (automatic via LanguageProvider)
- **English (en)**: International English
- **Portuguese (pt)**: Portuguese translations
- **Spanish (es)**: Spanish translations

## Implementation Steps

1. **Add translations** to en.json, pt.json, es.json
2. **Update EducationalModal.tsx** to use the dynamic content generator
3. **Fetch organization context** (country, sector) from user session/org data
4. **Pass context** to content generator for dynamic examples

## Benefits

âœ… **Fully internationalized** - All content uses i18n system
âœ… **Context-aware** - Examples relevant to user's location and industry
âœ… **Scalable** - Easy to add new languages and sectors
âœ… **Dynamic** - Content adapts automatically based on organization
âœ… **Maintainable** - All content in translation files, not hardcoded

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Create the full translation files for all 3 languages?
2. Update the EducationalModal to use the dynamic system?
3. Add organization context fetching?
