```

### 2. AI Intelligence System

The platform uses a sophisticated multi-brain architecture:

```typescript
// Core AI Brains
├── sustainability-intelligence.ts  # Master sustainability brain
├── conversational-engine.ts       # Natural language processing
├── predictive-analytics.ts        # Forecasting and predictions
├── recommendation-engine.ts       # Action recommendations
├── autonomous-engine.ts           # Autonomous actions
├── multi-brain-orchestrator.ts    # Coordinates all brains
└── context-engine.ts              # Rich context building
```

#### AI Capabilities

1. **Analysis**: Real-time emissions tracking, energy analysis, compliance checking
2. **Prediction**: Forecast emissions, predict equipment failures, anticipate regulations
3. **Recommendation**: Suggest optimizations, identify savings, propose strategies
4. **Automation**: Execute approved actions, manage systems, generate reports
5. **Learning**: Adapt to patterns, improve accuracy, personalize responses

### 3. Data Architecture

#### Database Schema (Supabase/PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Multi-tenant structure
organizations -> buildings -> users
             -> sustainability_metrics
             -> emissions_data
             -> targets & milestones
             -> compliance_records

-- Real-time features
conversations -> messages -> ui_components
             -> attachments
             -> ai_context
```

#### External Data Sources

- **Weather Data**: OpenWeatherMap for environmental conditions
- **Carbon Data**: Electricity Maps, Climatiq for emission factors
- **Regulatory**: Compliance databases and standards APIs
- **Market Data**: Carbon credit markets, renewable energy pricing

### 4. Security & Access Control

#### Role Hierarchy

1. **Account Owner**: Full access, billing, team management
2. **Sustainability Manager**: All sustainability features, reporting
3. **Facility Manager**: Building operations, limited reporting
4. **Analyst**: Read-only access, report generation
5. **Viewer**: Basic read-only access

#### Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
- OAuth 2.0 authentication (Google, Microsoft)
- API key management for external services
- Encrypted file storage in Supabase

## Key Technical Features

### 1. Document Intelligence

```typescript
// Automatic emission extraction from documents
- Invoices: Extract vendor, items, calculate Scope 3 emissions
- Utility Bills: Parse usage, calculate Scope 2 emissions
- Travel Documents: Extract distance, mode, calculate emissions
- Certificates: Verify compliance, extract validity periods
- Reports: Parse existing sustainability data
```

### 2. Real-time Streaming

- WebSocket connections via Supabase Realtime
- Server-sent events for AI responses
- Live building data updates
- Instant team collaboration

### 3. Multi-LLM Orchestration

```typescript
// Provider priority and fallback
1. DeepSeek R1 (primary - fast & affordable)
2. OpenAI GPT-4 (fallback - reliable)
3. Anthropic Claude (fallback - complex reasoning)

// Automatic switching based on:
- Availability
- Response time
- Task complexity
- Cost optimization
```

### 4. Emission Calculations

```typescript
// Comprehensive emission tracking
Scope 1: Direct emissions (fuel, refrigerants)
Scope 2: Indirect energy (electricity, heating)
Scope 3: Value chain (travel, procurement, waste)

// Calculation methods
- Activity-based: Usage × Emission Factor
- Spend-based: Cost × Economic Factor
- Hybrid: Combination for accuracy
```

## API Architecture
