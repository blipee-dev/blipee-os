## NOTES

1. **No Double Counting**: Water and Transportation metrics in Scope 3 categories are excluded from the Scope 3 scoring to prevent double counting.

2. **Scope Alignment**:
   - Scope 1: Fugitive, Process, Mobile Combustion, Stationary Combustion, Raw Materials, Recycled Materials, Packaging
   - Scope 2: Electricity, Purchased Energy
   - Scope 3: Business Travel, Employee Commuting, Waste, Water, Upstream/Downstream Transport, Capital Goods, etc.

3. **Human Experience**: Currently not tracked in database. Needs to be added for complete Arc Skoru parity.

4. **Data Quality**: Scoring accounts for data completeness and confidence levels. Categories with no data receive 0 score but weight is redistributed to categories with data.
