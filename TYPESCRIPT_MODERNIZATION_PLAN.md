# COORDINATION & INTEGRATION

## Phase Team Coordination

### Weekly Sync Schedule
- **Monday 9:30 AM**: Phase team check-in (15 min)
- **Wednesday 2:00 PM**: Progress review with leads (30 min)
- **Friday 4:00 PM**: Week wrap-up and planning (30 min)

### Integration Points
| Phase | Integration Needs | Coordination Required |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 3 | AI service types must align with queue system | Daily Slack updates |
| 4 | Logging types must match monitoring infrastructure | Bi-weekly sync |
| 5 | Test types must support QA test suite | Weekly coordination |

## Risk Management

### Potential Blockers
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Merge conflicts with feature development | HIGH | Coordinate PR timing, use feature branches | TS Dev |
| Breaking changes from Phase teams | MEDIUM | Daily communication, staged rollouts | Both |
| Complex type refactoring needs | MEDIUM | Escalate to architecture review | TS Dev |
| Developer availability/capacity | HIGH | Cross-train backup developer | Manager |
