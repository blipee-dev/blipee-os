# Pie Chart Zero Values Fix

## Issue
The "Top Fontes de Emissão" (Top Emission Sources) pie chart was displaying entries with 0 emissions, creating visual clutter and meaningless slices in the chart.

## Solution
Added filtering to exclude zero-value entries from pie chart data in both dashboard components.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/dashboard/EmissionsDashboard.tsx`
**Lines**: 853-869

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Included all top 5 sources regardless of value
const top5 = topEmitters.slice(0, 5);
const others = topEmitters.slice(5);

// After: Filter out zero values
const top5 = topEmitters.slice(0, 5).filter(source => source.emissions > 0);
const others = topEmitters.slice(5).filter(source => source.emissions > 0);

// Also updated "Others" category condition
// Before: if (others.length > 0)
// After: if (others.length > 0 && othersTotal > 0)
```

### 2. `/src/components/dashboard/OverviewDashboard.tsx`
**Lines**: 553-569

**Changes**: Same filtering logic applied to ensure consistency across all dashboard views.

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Pie charts showed entries like "Category X: 0.0 tCO2e (0%)"
- Visual clutter with meaningless slices
- Confusing UX - why show something with no emissions?

### After Fix:
- ✅ Only non-zero emission sources appear in pie chart
- ✅ Cleaner, more meaningful visualization
- ✅ "Others" category only appears if it has non-zero emissions
- ✅ Better data presentation for stakeholders

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to dashboard with site filter applied
2. Select a site with limited emission sources
3. Check the "Top Fontes de Emissão" pie chart
4. Confirm that only sources with emissions > 0 are displayed
5. Verify "Others" category only appears when relevant
