| Scalability issues | Cloud-first architecture, horizontal scaling ready |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| User adoption | Amazing onboarding, immediate value demonstration |
| Competition | Move fast, patent innovations, build community |
| Pricing resistance | Clear ROI demonstration, freemium tier |
