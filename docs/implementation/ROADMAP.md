## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI response latency | Implement streaming, caching, edge deployment |
| High API costs | Token optimization, response caching, tiered models |
| Complex integrations | Start with mock data, add real integrations later |
| Scalability issues | Cloud-first architecture, horizontal scaling ready |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| User adoption | Amazing onboarding, immediate value demonstration |
| Competition | Move fast, patent innovations, build community |
| Pricing resistance | Clear ROI demonstration, freemium tier |

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] < 2 second response time (95th percentile)
- [ ] 99.9% uptime from day 1
- [ ] Zero critical bugs at launch
- [ ] Support for 1000 concurrent users

### Business
- [ ] 100 users in first week
- [ ] 50% daily active usage
- [ ] 5 paying customers in week 1
- [ ] Net Promoter Score > 70

### User Experience
- [ ] Onboarding completion > 90%
- [ ] Average session > 10 minutes
- [ ] User-generated content (shared conversations)
- [ ] Organic referrals

## Post-Launch Roadmap

### Month 2-3

## Key Decisions Made

1. **AI-First:** Every feature starts with conversation
2. **Cloud-Native:** No on-premise version initially
3. **Premium Positioning:** Quality over quantity
4. **Streaming Everything:** Real-time or broken
5. **Learn Fast:** Ship daily, iterate constantly

## Daily Standup Format

```
1. What did we ship yesterday?
2. What are we shipping today?
3. What's blocking shipment?
4. User feedback actions
```
