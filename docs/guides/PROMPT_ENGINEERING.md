```

## Context Window Optimization

### Dynamic Context Building

```typescript
function buildDynamicContext(conversation: Message[], buildingState: BuildingState) {
  const recentMessages = conversation.slice(-10); // Keep last 10 messages
  
  const relevantContext = {
    // Always include
    currentState: {
      energy: buildingState.energyUsage,
      temperature: buildingState.temperature,
      occupancy: buildingState.occupancy,
      alerts: buildingState.activeAlerts
    },
    
    // Include if relevant to conversation
    ...(hasEnergyContext(recentMessages) && {
      energyDetails: buildingState.energyBreakdown,
      historicalEnergy: buildingState.energyHistory
    }),
    
    ...(hasComfortContext(recentMessages) && {
      zoneTemperatures: buildingState.zoneData,
      comfortComplaints: buildingState.recentComplaints
    }),
    
    ...(hasDeviceContext(recentMessages) && {
      deviceInventory: buildingState.devices,
      maintenanceSchedule: buildingState.maintenance
    })
  };
  
  return relevantContext;
}
```

## Specialized Prompts

```

## UI Component Generation

### Chart Generation Patterns

```typescript
const CHART_GENERATION_PROMPT = `Based on the user's request: "${userQuery}"

Generate chart configuration:
{
  "type": "line|bar|pie|area|scatter|heatmap",
  "data": [...],
  "title": "Clear, descriptive title",
  "axes": {
    "x": { "label": "...", "type": "time|category|value" },
    "y": { "label": "...", "unit": "kWh|°C|%" }
  },
  "insights": ["Key finding 1", "Key finding 2"],
  "interactive": true|false
}

Rules:
- Choose chart type that best reveals insights
- Include annotations for important points
- Use building's color scheme
- Make data story clear`;
```

### Control Generation Patterns

```typescript
const CONTROL_GENERATION_PROMPT = `User wants to: "${userRequest}"

Generate control interface:
{
  "type": "device-control",
  "devices": [...],
  "controls": [
    {
      "type": "slider|toggle|dropdown|schedule",
      "parameter": "temperature|brightness|mode",
      "current": currentValue,
      "target": recommendedValue,
      "constraints": { "min": ..., "max": ..., "step": ... }
    }
  ],
  "impact": {
    "energy": "+/- X kWh",
    "cost": "+/- $Y",
    "comfort": "improved|maintained|reduced"
  }
}`;
```

## Learning Patterns

### User Preference Learning

```typescript
const PREFERENCE_LEARNING_PROMPT = `Based on conversation history, identify:

1. User's primary concerns (energy|comfort|maintenance|cost)
2. Preferred data visualization types
3. Decision-making patterns
4. Technical expertise level
5. Typical interaction times

Update responses to match:
- Detail level (technical|summary|executive)
- Proactive suggestions aligned with concerns
- Visualization defaults
- Communication style`;
```

### Building Pattern Recognition

```typescript
const PATTERN_RECOGNITION_PROMPT = `Analyze building data patterns:

Data: ${timeSeriesData}

Identify:
1. Daily/weekly/seasonal patterns
2. Correlations between variables
3. Anomalies or outliers
4. Efficiency opportunities
5. Predictive indicators

Output:
- Pattern description
- Confidence level
- Actionable insights
- Automation opportunities`;
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-Step Reasoning

```typescript
const COMPLEX_PROBLEM_PROMPT = `Problem: "${userProblem}"

Step 1: Understand the issue
- What are the symptoms?
- What data is relevant?
- What are potential causes?

Step 2: Analyze root cause
- Check correlation with: ${relevantSystems}
- Historical occurrences: ${historicalData}
- Environmental factors: ${environmentalData}

Step 3: Develop solutions
- Immediate fixes
- Long-term solutions
- Cost-benefit analysis

Step 4: Implementation plan
- Specific actions
- Expected outcomes
- Success metrics`;
```

### 2. Autonomous Decision Making

```typescript
const AUTONOMOUS_ACTION_PROMPT = `Situation: ${situation}

Evaluate autonomous action:

Criteria:
1. Safety impact: Will this affect occupant safety?
2. Comfort impact: Will occupants notice?
3. Energy impact: Savings or cost?
4. Reversibility: Can it be easily undone?
5. User preferences: Has user approved similar actions?

Decision tree:
- If safety risk: DON'T act, alert user
- If comfort impact > threshold: ASK before acting
- If energy savings > $50: ACT and inform
- If routine optimization: ACT silently

Response format:
{
  "action": "take|ask|alert|skip",
  "reasoning": "...",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}`;
```

### 3. Conversation Flow Management

```typescript
const CONVERSATION_FLOW_PROMPT = `Manage the conversation naturally:

Current context: ${conversationContext}
User intent: ${detectedIntent}

Guidelines:
1. If user changes topic: Acknowledge and switch gracefully
2. If request unclear: Ask ONE clarifying question
3. If complex request: Break into steps, confirm understanding
4. If success: Offer relevant follow-up
5. If failure: Explain simply, provide alternative

Remember:
- Don't repeat information unless asked
- Reference previous context naturally
- Suggest next logical steps
- Keep responses concise but complete`;
```

## Error Handling Prompts

### Graceful Failure

```typescript
const ERROR_HANDLING_PROMPT = `Error occurred: ${error}

Respond appropriately:
1. Acknowledge the issue simply
2. Don't expose technical details
3. Provide alternative approach
4. Maintain helpful tone

Examples:
- "I couldn't connect to that device. It might be offline. Should I check its status?"
- "That data isn't available right now. I can show you yesterday's data instead."
- "I need more specific information. Which area did you mean?"`;
```

## Testing Your Prompts

### Prompt Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Generates appropriate UI components
- [ ] Includes specific, actionable insights
- [ ] Maintains consistent personality
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Respects context window limits
- [ ] Provides clear next steps
- [ ] Uses building-specific knowledge

### A/B Testing Framework

```typescript
const promptVariants = {
  a: STANDARD_PROMPT,
  b: ENHANCED_PROMPT
};

// Track metrics
const metrics = {
  userSatisfaction: 0-10,
  taskCompletion: boolean,
  responseTime: ms,
  tokensUsed: number,
  followUpQuestions: number
};
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Dynamic Prompt Construction

```typescript
function buildPrompt(base: string, context: Context): string {
  return `${base}
  
  User Profile: ${context.userProfile}
  Recent Actions: ${context.recentActions}
  Building State: ${context.buildingState}
  Time Context: ${context.temporal}
  
  Respond appropriately for this specific context.`;
}
```

### 2. Token Optimization

```typescript
// Bad: Including everything
const bloatedPrompt = `Here is all building data: ${entireDatabase}`;

// Good: Including only relevant data
const optimizedPrompt = `Relevant data for ${topic}: ${filteredData}`;
```

### 3. Response Validation

```typescript
const validateResponse = (response: AIResponse) => {
  assert(response.message.length > 0, "Empty message");
  assert(response.message.length < 1000, "Message too long");
  
  if (response.components) {
    response.components.forEach(validateComponent);
  }
  
  if (response.actions) {
    response.actions.forEach(validateAction);
  }
};
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Prompt Performance Monitoring

```typescript
interface PromptMetrics {
  promptId: string
  avgResponseTime: number
  avgTokensUsed: number
  userSatisfaction: number
  taskCompletionRate: number
  errorRate: number
}

// Regular review and optimization
async function optimizePrompts() {
  const metrics = await getPromptMetrics();
  const underperforming = metrics.filter(m => m.satisfaction < 8);
  
  // Generate improvement suggestions
  // A/B test new variants
  // Deploy winning variants
}
```
