- Current: 4.2MW (â†“8% from yesterday)
- Projected monthly cost: $47,200

**Comfort Issues** (Your top priority)
- 2 hot calls on Floor 7
- Conference Room B still too cold

**Equipment Health** (You asked about this yesterday)
- Chiller #2 efficiency still declining
- All other systems nominal

Want me to always show this summary when you log in?"

### 10. Natural Language Automation

**User:** "Every Monday at 6 AM, warm up the building but only if it's below 15Â°C outside"

**Blipee:** "I've created a smart automation for you:

**Monday Morning Warm-up**
- Trigger: Every Monday at 6:00 AM
- Condition: Outside temperature < 15Â°C
- Actions:
  - Start HVAC in warm-up mode
  - Target 21Â°C by 8:00 AM
  - Optimize for energy efficiency

This will ensure the building is comfortable when people arrive while avoiding unnecessary heating. Based on weather patterns, this will activate approximately 20 Mondays per year, saving about $3,600 annually compared to running every Monday."

**Components Generated:**

- Projected savings chart
- Test simulation button

## Multi-turn Conversations

### 11. Investigative Analysis

**User:** "Something seems wrong with the energy usage"

**Blipee:** "I'm analyzing your energy patterns... You're right. I've detected an unusual 35% spike in consumption that started at 3:47 AM. Let me investigate further."

**User:** "What's causing it?"

**Blipee:** "I've traced the spike to the HVAC system in Building B. Specifically:
- VAV boxes on Floor 3 are calling for simultaneous heating and cooling
- This is causing the system to fight itself
- Likely cause: Failed temperature sensor in Zone 3-A

This is wasting approximately 45kW. Should I override the local controls to stop the waste?"

**User:** "Yes, and create a work order"

**Blipee:** "Done! I've:
1. Overridden the conflicting commands - energy usage dropping now
2. Created emergency work order #WO-2847 for sensor replacement
3. Notified the on-call technician (ETA: 45 minutes)

You'll save about $200 by catching this early. I'll monitor for similar issues in other zones."

### 12. What-If Scenarios

**User:** "What if we switch to the new electricity rate plan?"

**Blipee:** "I'll analyze the impact of switching to the Time-of-Use rate plan using your actual usage data from the last 12 months:

**Current Plan:** $52,400/month average
**New TOU Plan:** $48,700/month average
**Savings:** $3,700/month (7.1%)

However, this assumes no behavior change. If we shift 20% of your peak usage to off-peak hours (which I can automate), savings increase to $6,200/month.

The main risk: Peak hour rates are 3x higher, so any emergency usage during peak times could offset savings."

**Components Generated:**
- Cost comparison chart
- Hour-by-hour rate visualization
- Savings simulator with adjustable parameters

## Error Handling

### 13. Graceful Failures

**User:** "Control the HVAC in Building X"

**Blipee:** "I don't see a 'Building X' in your portfolio. You currently manage:
- Downtown Office Tower (Building A)
- Riverside Complex (Building B)
- Innovation Center (Building C)

Which building did you mean? Or would you like to add a new building to your account?"

### 14. Clarification Requests

**User:** "Make it cooler"

**Blipee:** "I'd be happy to adjust the temperature. Could you clarify:
- Which area? (I see you're currently in Conference Room B)
- How much cooler? (Current temperature is 23Â°C)

Or I can simply lower the temperature by 2Â°C in your current location?"

## Integration Examples

### 15. Calendar Integration

**User:** "Prepare the conference room for my 2 PM meeting"

**Blipee:** "I see your 2 PM Strategy Session in Conference Room A with 12 attendees. I'll prepare the room:

âœ… Temperature set to 21Â°C (your preferred meeting temp)
âœ… Lights will activate at 1:50 PM
âœ… AV system powered on
âœ… Fresh air ventilation increased for 12 people

The room will be perfect when you arrive. Should I also send the WiFi password to attendees?"

### 16. Integration Creation

**User:** "Can you connect to our new Schneider Electric system?"

**Blipee:** "I can create an integration for your Schneider Electric system. I'll need:

1. System IP address or hostname
2. API credentials or BACnet configuration
3. List of points you want to monitor

I can automatically discover and map most Schneider devices. Once connected, you'll be able to control and monitor everything through our conversation. Should I start the integration wizard?"

## Best Practices Examples

### 17. Proactive Insights

**Blipee:** "Good morning! I noticed something interesting overnight:
Your building used 30% less energy than similar buildings during yesterday's heatwave. Your improved insulation project is really paying off - you saved approximately $340 yesterday alone."

### 18. Contextual Awareness

**User:** "Show me the data"

**Blipee:** "Here's the energy savings data from the heatwave analysis I just mentioned:"
