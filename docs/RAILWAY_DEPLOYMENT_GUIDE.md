# Railway Deployment Guide - Agent Worker
## Blipee AI Autonomous Agents + ML Models + Prophet Forecasting

**Service:** Agent Worker (Multi-process container)
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for deployment

---

## Overview

This deployment runs **2 services in one container**:
1. **Node.js Agent Worker** (Port 8080)
   - 8 Autonomous AI Agents
   - ML Model Training Service
   - Proactive Agent Scheduler
   - Background job processing

2. **Python Prophet Service** (Port 8001)

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Repository

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root
cd /Users/pedro/Documents/blipee/blipee-os/blipee-os

# Check that required files exist
ls -la railway.json
ls -la Dockerfile.worker
ls -la supervisord.conf

# Verify services directory
ls -la services/forecast-service/

# Check git status
git status
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes (if needed)

```bash
# Add deployment files
git add railway.json Dockerfile.worker supervisord.conf
git add services/ src/workers/

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add Railway deployment configuration for agent worker"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Via CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy current directory
railway up

# Follow deployment logs
railway logs

# The deployment will:
# 1. Build multi-stage Docker image
# 2. Install Node.js dependencies
# 3. Install Python dependencies + Prophet
# 4. Install cmdstan for Prophet
# 5. Start supervisord
# 6. Launch agent-worker (port 8080)

```

#### Option B: Via Dashboard
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "New Service"
4. Choose "GitHub Repo"
5. Select `blipee-os` repository
6. Railway will auto-detect `railway.json`
7. Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
railway logs --follow

# Check service health
railway run curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Or from Railway dashboard
# Services ‚Üí Agent Worker ‚Üí Logs
```

---

## Health Check Endpoint

The agent worker exposes a `/health` endpoint:

```bash
# Health check response
GET http://your-service.railway.app/health

# Expected Response (200 OK):
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "agents": {
    "mode": "global",
    "totalAgents": 8,
    "organizations": 1,
    "crossOrgBenchmarking": true
  },

## Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs
```bash
# All logs
railway logs

# Follow live logs
railway logs --follow

# Filter by service
railway logs --filter "agent-worker"
railway logs --filter "prophet-service"

# Search logs
railway logs | grep "ERROR"
railway logs | grep "Proactive Scheduler"
```

### Key Log Patterns

#### Successful Startup
```
üöÄ Starting Blipee AI Global Agent Worker...
‚úÖ Global workforce initialized successfully
   ‚Ä¢ 8 agents active globally
‚úÖ Subscribed to global task results (all organizations)
‚úÖ Global agent worker fully operational
üè• Health check server listening on port 8080
```

#### Proactive Messages
```
ü§ñ [Proactive Scheduler] Starting hourly check...
üìä Checking 1 organizations
üîç Checking triggers for PLMJ
‚úÖ Sent 2 proactive messages for PLMJ
```

#### ML Training
```
ü§ñ [ML Training] Starting model training cycle...
üìö Training models for 121 metrics from catalog
‚úÖ Model trained successfully
üìä Stored 70 models in database
```

#### Prophet Forecasting
```
üîÆ [Forecast Service] Starting forecast generation...
üìä Generating forecasts for 41 metrics
‚úÖ Generated 365 forecast points
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Current Configuration
- **Replicas**: 1 (single instance)
- **Resources**: Railway default (512MB RAM, shared CPU)

### Recommended for Production
```bash
# Increase resources (Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Settings)
Memory: 1GB - 2GB
CPU: Shared (default) or Dedicated

# Keep replicas at 1 for now
# (Agent scheduler needs coordination for multiple replicas)
```

### Future Scaling
For multiple replicas:
1. Implement Redis-based job queue
2. Add distributed locks (Redis)
3. Use Railway cron jobs instead of in-process cron
4. Separate Prophet service to dedicated instance

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Health check failing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if services are running
railway run supervisorctl status

# Expected output:
# agent-worker     RUNNING   pid 123, uptime 0:05:00
# prophet-service  RUNNING   pid 124, uptime 0:04:55

# Check logs
railway logs --filter "health"
```

### Issue: Prophet service not starting

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check cmdstan installation
railway run ls -la /root/.cmdstan

# Check Python dependencies
railway run pip3 list | grep prophet

# Manually test Prophet service
railway run curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Issue: Database connection errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Test database connection
railway run node -e "const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const s = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); s.from('organizations').select('count').then(console.log)"
```

### Issue: Out of memory

**Solution:**
1. Increase memory allocation in Railway dashboard
2. Check for memory leaks in logs
3. Reduce ML model training frequency
4. Implement model caching

### Issue: Agent not sending messages

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check agent task queue
railway run node -e "const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const s = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); s.from('agent_task_results').select('*').limit(5).then(console.log)"

# Check conversations table
railway run node -e "const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const s = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); s.from('conversations').select('*').eq('type', 'agent_proactive').then(console.log)"
```

---

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Health Check
```bash
# From your machine
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health

# Should return 200 OK with JSON
```

### 2. Check Database
```sql
-- Verify agent activity (should show recent entries)
SELECT agent_name, activity_type, created_at
FROM agent_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check ML predictions (should increase over time)
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_predictions
FROM ml_predictions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Check proactive messages
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_messages
FROM messages
WHERE role = 'agent'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### 3. Monitor Cron Jobs
Wait for scheduled jobs to run:
- Next hour: Proactive Scheduler, Weather Data
- Next 4 hours: Prophet Forecasting
- Tomorrow 02:00 UTC: Metrics Pre-Computation
- Tomorrow 03:00 UTC: Data Cleanup

Check logs to confirm execution.

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails or has issues:

```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
railway rollback

# Or redeploy from specific commit
git checkout <previous-commit>
railway up

# Or disable service temporarily
railway down
```

---

## Maintenance Windows

Recommended maintenance schedule:

- **Weekly**: Review logs, check for errors
- **Monthly**: Review performance metrics, optimize queries
- **Quarterly**: Review ML model performance, retrain if needed

---

## Cost Estimation (Railway)

**Agent Worker Service:**
- Starter Plan: $5/month (512MB RAM, shared CPU)
- Developer Plan: $20/month (2GB RAM, priority builds)
- Team Plan: $20/user/month (4GB RAM, dedicated CPU)

**Estimated Monthly Cost:**
- Development: $5-20
- Production: $20-50 (depending on usage)

**Database (Supabase):**
- Already configured and running
- No additional cost for Railway
