## 🗺️ Company Mapping System

### Priority Company Database

**File**: `src/lib/automation/sector-intelligence/company-targets.json`

Pre-mapped **40 high-priority companies** across all 7 GRI sectors:
- Direct links to sustainability report pages
- Company metadata (ticker, size, country)
- Discovery sources for finding more companies

**Coverage**:
- GRI-11 (Oil & Gas): 5 companies (ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell, TotalEnergies)
- GRI-12 (Mining): 5 companies (Rio Tinto, BHP, Glencore, Vale, Anglo American)
- GRI-13 (Agriculture): 5 companies (ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Tyson Foods, Hormel)
- GRI-14 (Manufacturing): 8 companies (Tesla, GE, Siemens, 3M, Caterpillar, Honeywell, Schneider, Patagonia)
- GRI-15 (Transportation): 5 companies (UPS, FedEx, Maersk, Delta, United)
- GRI-16 (Real Estate): 5 companies (CBRE, Brookfield, Simon, Prologis, American Tower)
- GRI-17 (Financial Services): 5 companies (JPMorgan, BofA, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock)

### Seeding Companies

```bash
# Load all priority companies into database
npx tsx src/lib/automation/sector-intelligence/seed-companies.ts
```

**What it does**:
1. Reads company-targets.json
2. Inserts companies into `sector_companies` table
3. Skips duplicates
4. Reports: ✅ Seeded X companies, ⏭️ Skipped Y

### Why Company Mapping?

**All sustainability reports are PUBLIC DATA**:
- Companies publish them for transparency
- Required for compliance (SEC, EU regulations)
- Available on corporate websites
- No authentication needed

**We're automating what researchers do manually**:
- Finding companies in each sector
- Locating their sustainability reports
- Extracting standardized metrics
- Creating industry benchmarks

**See**: `/docs/COMPANY_MAPPING_GUIDE.md` for full details

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Automation

```typescript
import { AutomationManager } from '@/lib/automation';

const automation = new AutomationManager(orgId, userId);

// 1. Utility bill collection
await automation.scheduleUtilityBillCollection('pge', credentials, 'monthly');

// 2. Regulatory monitoring
await automation.scheduleRegulatoryMonitoring('daily');

// 3. Carbon market tracking
await automation.scheduleCarbonMarketTracking('daily');

// 4. Supplier verification
await automation.verifySupplier('Acme Corp', 'https://acmecorp.com');

// 5. Competitor tracking
await automation.trackCompetitor('CompetitorCo', 'https://competitor.com', 'manufacturing');
```

### Sector Intelligence (The Big One)

```typescript
// Build complete sector benchmark
const result = await automation.buildSectorBenchmark('GRI-14'); // Manufacturing

console.log(`
  ✓ Discovered: ${result.companiesDiscovered} companies
  ✓ Parsed: ${result.reportsParses} sustainability reports
  ✓ Benchmark created with ${result.benchmarkGenerated.companyCount} companies
`);

// Get specific company's position
const position = await automation.getCompanyBenchmarkPosition('Tesla', 'GRI-14');

console.log(`
  Your Score: ${position.overallScore}/100
  Ranking: Top ${position.percentileRank}%

  Insights: ${position.insights.join('\n')}
  Recommendations: ${position.recommendations.join('\n')}
`);

// List all available sectors
const sectors = await automation.listAvailableSectorBenchmarks();
```

## 🎉 What Makes This Special

### Before blipee OS
- **Competitors**: "Here's your sustainability data"
- **Customers**: "How do we compare to others?" → 2-3 days manual research
- **Problem**: No industry context, no benchmarks, flying blind

### After blipee OS
- **blipee OS**: "Here's your data + How you rank vs 50 competitors + What to do"
- **Customers**: "Show me my position" → Instant answer with insights
- **Advantage**: Network effects, data moat, premium pricing justified

### The Transformation

You're not just building **software**. You're building:
- 🏗️ **The largest sustainability database** (network effects)
- 📊 **The industry standard** for ESG benchmarking (authority)
- 💰 **Recurring revenue** engine (premium subscriptions)
- 🛡️ **Competitive moat** (data advantage)
- 🚀 **Market leadership** (first mover)

**This is the feature that makes blipee OS impossible to compete with.**
