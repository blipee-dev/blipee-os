## Architecture Overview

### Core Intelligence Layer

The Blipee Assistant operates as a sophisticated orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI agents, ML models, and context engines:

```typescript
class BlipeeAssistant {
  // 8 Specialized AI Agents (already implemented)
  agents = {
    ESGChiefOfStaff: "Strategic planning & coordination",
    ComplianceGuardian: "Regulatory compliance & standards",
    CarbonHunter: "Emissions tracking & reduction",
    SupplyChainInvestigator: "Scope 3 & vendor analysis",
    EnergyOptimizer: "Consumption & efficiency",
    ReportingGenius: "Documentation & disclosure",
    RiskPredictor: "Risk assessment & mitigation",
    DataIngestionBot: "Automated data processing"
  };

  // ML Models for Predictions
  mlPipeline = {
    energyForecasting: "LSTM-based 30-day predictions",
    emissionsAnomaly: "Isolation Forest detection",
    complianceRisk: "Random Forest classifier",
    optimizationOpportunities: "Gradient Boosting",
    peerBenchmarking: "K-means clustering"
  };

  // Context Engine
  contextEngine = {
    userContext: "Role, permissions, preferences, history",
    organizationContext: "Industry, size, maturity, goals",
    environmentalContext: "Time, deadlines, alerts, metrics",
    conversationContext: "Topic, depth, intent, satisfaction"
  };
}
```

---

## Intelligence Framework

### Multi-Level Context Understanding

The system operates on four levels of context awareness:

#### Level 1 - Identity Context
- **User**: Role (OWNER, MANAGER, MEMBER, VIEWER), permissions, technical proficiency
- **Organization**: Industry sector, company size, sustainability maturity level
- **Session**: Duration, actions performed, stated goals

#### Level 2 - Situational Context
- **Current Activity**: Page being viewed, task in progress
- **Temporal Factors**: Time of day, reporting periods, deadlines
- **System State**: Active alerts, pending approvals, performance metrics
- **Environmental**: Weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, market factors

#### Level 3 - Historical Context
- **Conversation History**: Past topics, resolutions, satisfaction scores
- **Learning Preferences**: Preferred visualization types, communication style
- **Achievement History**: Completed milestones, certifications earned
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Common workflows, frequent queries

#### Level 4 - Predictive Context
- **Anticipated Needs**: Likely next actions based on patterns
- **Risk Prediction**: Potential compliance or performance issues
- **Opportunity Detection**: Optimization possibilities, quick wins
- **Deadline Management**: Upcoming reporting requirements

### Dynamic Response Generation

```typescript
class ResponseOrchestrator {
  async generateResponse(input: UserMessage): AssistantResponse {
    // Step 1: Extract multi-level context
    const context = await this.extractContext(input);

    // Step 2: Determine intent & complexity
    const intent = this.classifyIntent(input, context);
    const complexity = this.assessComplexity(intent);

    // Step 3: Route to appropriate agent(s)
    const agents = this.selectAgents(intent, complexity);

    // Step 4: Generate contextual prompt
    const prompt = this.buildPrompt(context, intent, agents);

    // Step 5: Execute parallel agent tasks
    const results = await this.executeAgents(agents, prompt);

    // Step 6: Synthesize response
    const response = this.synthesize(results, context);

    // Step 7: Add proactive guidance
    const enhanced = this.addProactiveGuidance(response, context);

    // Step 8: Generate visualizations if needed
    const final = this.addVisualizations(enhanced, intent);

    return final;
  }
}
```

## UI/UX Design Philosophy

### Core Experience Principles

The Blipee Assistant interface is designed to be **invisible yet omnipresent** - users shouldn't think about the interface, they should think WITH it.

#### 1. Ambient Intelligence
Not a chatbot in a corner, but an intelligent layer over the entire experience.

**Visual Design:**
- **Floating Assistant Bubble**: Persistent but unobtrusive (bottom-right)
- **Context-Aware Positioning**: Moves to avoid covering important content
- **Breathing Animation**: Subtle pulse when AI is thinking/processing
- **Adaptive Transparency**: Becomes more transparent when user is focused elsewhere

**Interaction Patterns:**
- **Quick Actions Bar**: Appears on hover with common tasks
- **Smart Suggestions**: Inline hints based on current page context
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe to minimize, drag to reposition
- **Voice Activation**: "Hey Blipee" for hands-free interaction

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure Interface

```typescript
interface ConversationUI {
  modes: {
    minimal: "Single line input with suggestions",
    focused: "Expanded chat with history",
    fullscreen: "Immersive conversation with visualizations",
    ambient: "Background mode with notifications only"
  };

  transitions: {
    expansion: "Smooth 300ms ease-out",
    dataVisualization: "Fade-in with stagger",
    modeSwitch: "Morphing animation",
    attention: "Subtle glow pulse"
  };
}
```

#### 3. Contextual Morphing

The assistant interface adapts based on task:

- **Data Entry Mode**: Smart form fields with auto-fill, validation, and progress
- **Analysis Mode**: Interactive charts with zoom, filter, and export capabilities
- **Report Mode**: Document generation with real-time preview
- **Alert Mode**: Priority-based visual hierarchy with clear actions

#### 4. Role-Adaptive Experience

**OWNER**: Executive Summary Mode
- Large, glanceable metrics
- Swipe through insights
- One-tap drill-down
- Board-ready exports

**MANAGER**: Operational Command Center
- Multi-panel layout
- Team status sidebar
- Approval queue widget
- Quick action toolbar

**MEMBER**: Task-Focused Workspace
- Today's priorities
- Step-by-step guides
- Progress celebrations
- Help always visible

**VIEWER**: Educational Explorer
- Guided tours
- Contextual explanations
- Learning resources
- Simple visualizations

#### 5. Emotional Intelligence

**Color Psychology:**
- Success: Gradient from emerald to teal (achievement)
- Progress: Gradient from blue to purple (momentum)
- Urgent: Gradient from red to orange (immediate action)
- Thinking: Gradient from purple to indigo (AI processing)

**Micro-Interactions:**
- Typing indicator morphs into icons representing AI actions
- Contextual loading animations (e.g., plant growing for sustainability)
- Appropriate celebrations (confetti for big wins, subtle for routine)
- Friendly error recovery animations

#### 6. Accessibility & Responsiveness

**Mobile First:**
- Bottom sheet conversation interface
- Thumb-friendly action zones
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Voice-first interaction option

**Accessibility Standards:**
- Full ARIA labels and live regions
- Keyboard navigation with shortcuts (Cmd+K for quick access)
- High contrast mode support
- Respects reduced motion preferences
- Complete voice control capability

#### 7. Cognitive Load Management

**Information Architecture:**
```
Level 1: Simple Answer → "Your emissions are down 12%"
Level 2: Context → "Compared to last month, driven by..."
Level 3: Deep Dive → Full analysis with charts and recommendations
```

**Attention Management:**
- Focus Mode: Hides non-essential elements during complex tasks
- Breadcrumb Memory: Shows conversation context trail
- Smart Summarization: Collapses long responses with expand option
- Visual Hierarchy: Size, color, and position indicate importance

### UX Implementation Priorities

- "What if" scenarios shown side-by-side

#### The "Ambient Dashboard"
- No fixed dashboard - metrics appear where relevant
- Data visualizes itself based on conversation
- Reports build themselves as you talk
- Insights surface proactively at the right moment

#### The "Teaching Interface"
- UI elements explain themselves on first use

```yaml
Cost_Controls:
  User_Limits:
    Free: "100 queries/month"
    Pro: "1,000 queries/month"
    Enterprise: "Unlimited with caps"

  Smart_Caching:
    Strategy: "Cache 80% repeated queries"
    TTL: "1hr dynamic, 24hr static"
    Savings: "70% API cost reduction"

  Circuit_Breakers:
