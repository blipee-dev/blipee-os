## Stream D Readiness Assessment

### Critical Dependencies Status:
1. **Database Schema** ‚ùå
   - Need: Network tables (nodes, edges, privacy layers)
   - Dependency: Stream A database migrations
   - ETA: Week 2, Day 2

2. **Authentication System** ‚ùå
   - Need: Multi-org data isolation
   - Dependency: Stream A permissions
   - ETA: Week 1, Day 5

3. **Base Infrastructure** ‚ùå
   - Need: Core AI service extensions
   - Dependency: Stream A & B foundations
   - ETA: Week 2, Day 5

4. **Data Models** ‚ùå
   - Need: ESG data structures
   - Dependency: Stream B feature engineering
   - ETA: Week 1, Day 4

### Recommended Stream D Start Date: **Week 3, Day 11**

## Weekly Progress Summary

### Week 1 (Current Week):
- **Stream A**: Building core infrastructure
- **Stream B**: Setting up ML pipeline
- **Stream C**: Not started (planned Week 2)
- **Stream D**: Not started (blocked)

### Integration Milestones:
- [ ] Week 2, Day 10: First integration test (A+B)
- [ ] Week 3, Day 15: Stream C integration ready
- [ ] Week 3, Day 11: Stream D can potentially start

## Risk Assessment for Stream D

### High Risk:
- Starting before database schema is ready
- No permission system for network data

### Medium Risk:
- Limited ML models for network intelligence
- No industry context for network matching

### Low Risk:
- UI components (can be mocked initially)
- External API integrations (can be stubbed)

---

## Monitoring Checklist (Update Daily)

### Daily Status Check:
- [ ] Stream A: On track? Blockers?
- [ ] Stream B: On track? Blockers?
- [ ] Stream C: Ready to start Week 2?
- [ ] Integration points: Any conflicts?
- [ ] Stream D dependencies: Progress?

### Key Metrics:
- Story points completed vs planned
- Test coverage percentage
- Integration tests passing
- Blocking issues count
