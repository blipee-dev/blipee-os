## Stream D Start Decision Tree

```
Week 1, Day 5 Check:
├─ Are database migrations complete? 
│  ├─ YES → Check permissions
│  └─ NO → ❌ Cannot start
│
├─ Is permission system working?
│  ├─ YES → Check ML pipeline
│  └─ NO → ❌ Cannot start
│
├─ Is basic ML pipeline ready?
│  ├─ YES → ⚠️ Can start with limitations
│  └─ NO → Check if mockable
│
└─ Week 2, Day 10 Check:
   ├─ All Stream A Week 1 complete?
   ├─ Stream B has 1+ models?
   ├─ Stream C has started?
   └─ YES to all → ✅ Optimal start time
```
