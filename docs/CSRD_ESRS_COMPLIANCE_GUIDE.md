# CSRD & ESRS Compliance Guide

**Purpose**: Enable blipee OS to track and benchmark Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) compliance.

**Market Impact**: 50,000+ companies must comply with CSRD (2024-2028 phased rollout) - this is a MASSIVE business opportunity.

---

## üá™üá∫ What is CSRD?

**CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)** is the EU's mandatory sustainability reporting framework that replaces the NFRD (Non-Financial Reporting Directive).

### Key Facts

- **Mandatory**: Not voluntary like GRI/SASB
- **Phased Rollout**: 2024-2028 (already started!)
- **Scope**: 50,000+ companies (EU + non-EU with EU operations)
- **Standards**: 12 ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards)
- **Audit Required**: External assurance mandatory
- **Penalties**: Heavy fines for non-compliance (varies by country)
- **Double Materiality**: Must assess both financial impact AND impact on people/planet

---

**~5,000 companies**
- Large EU companies already under NFRD

## üìö ESRS Standards (12 Standards)

### Cross-Cutting Standards (2)
1. **ESRS 1**: General Requirements (mandatory for all)
2. **ESRS 2**: General Disclosures (mandatory for all)

### Environmental Standards (5)
3. **ESRS E1**: Climate Change (mandatory)
4. **ESRS E2**: Pollution (apply or explain)
5. **ESRS E3**: Water and Marine Resources (apply or explain)
6. **ESRS E4**: Biodiversity and Ecosystems (apply or explain)

12. **ESRS G1**: Business Conduct (apply or explain)

**Note**: "Apply or explain" means either report on it OR explain why it's not material.

---

## üéØ Double Materiality Assessment (Required)

CSRD requires **double materiality** - unlike US standards that focus only on financial materiality.

### Financial Materiality
**Question**: How do sustainability matters affect the company's financial performance?
**Focus**: Risks and opportunities to the business
**Example**: Water scarcity risk affecting operations

### Impact Materiality
**Question**: How does the company affect people and the environment?
**Focus**: Company's impact on society and planet
**Example**: Water pollution from company operations

### Both Must Be Assessed
Companies must report on issues that are material from EITHER perspective:
- ‚úÖ Financially material only ‚Üí Report
- ‚úÖ Impact material only ‚Üí Report
- ‚úÖ Both ‚Üí Report
- ‚ùå Neither ‚Üí Can omit (with explanation)
