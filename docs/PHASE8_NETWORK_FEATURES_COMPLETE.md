### Key Technical Features

#### Supply Chain Investigation
```typescript
// Deep multi-tier investigation
const investigation = await investigator.planTask({
  supplierId: 'supplier_123',
  investigationType: 'deep_dive',
  scope: {
    supplyChainTiers: 5,
    areas: ['environmental', 'social', 'governance'],
    depth: 'comprehensive'
  }
});

// Evidence collection from multiple sources
const evidence = await investigator.collectEvidence(investigation);
// Includes: public records, financial data, satellite imagery,
// social media signals, third-party reports
```

#### Autonomous Negotiation
```typescript
// AI-driven negotiation session
const session = await negotiationEngine.initiateNegotiation({
  type: 'sustainability_commitments',
  parties: ['buyer_ai', 'supplier_rep'],
  objectives: [
    { metric: 'emissions_reduction', target: 30, priority: 9 },
    { metric: 'cost_increase', target: 5, priority: 7 }
  ],
  culturalAdaptation: true
});

// Autonomous negotiation rounds
const move = await negotiationEngine.conductNegotiationRound(sessionId);
```

#### Self-Improvement Loops
```typescript
// Continuous improvement cycle
const loop = await improvementEngine.createImprovementLoop(
  agentId,
  {
    domain: 'decision_making',
    objectives: [
      { metric: 'accuracy', target: 0.95 },
      { metric: 'speed', target: 100 } // ms
    ]
  },
  {
    experimentationRate: 0.1,
    learningRate: { initial: 0.03, decay: 'adaptive' }
  }
);

// Automated experimentation
await improvementEngine.runImprovementCycle(loopId);
```

#### Swarm Intelligence
```typescript
// Create intelligent swarm
const swarm = await swarmSystem.createSwarm({
  purpose: {
    mission: 'Complex supply chain investigation',
    objectives: ['explore', 'analyze', 'report']
  },
  topology: 'distributed',
  coordination: { model: 'emergent' },
  initialMembers: 20
});

// Execute collective task
const result = await swarmSystem.executeSwarmTask(swarmId, task);
```
