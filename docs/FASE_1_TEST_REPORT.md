## 1. ML Model Training & Performance

### Test Executed
```bash
npm run ml:train
```

### Results

#### Models Trained
| Model Type | Count | Status | Avg Accuracy | Last Trained |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Anomaly Detection** (Autoencoder) | 36 | active | 52.8% | 2025-10-30 18:57 |
| **Emissions Prediction** (LSTM) | 34 | active | - | 2025-10-30 18:57 |
| **TOTAL** | **70** | ✅ | - | - |

#### Training Coverage
```sql
SELECT model_type, COUNT(*) as total_models, status
FROM ml_models
WHERE organization_id = '22647141-2ee4-4d8d-8b47-16b0cbd830b2'
GROUP BY model_type, status;
```

**Result:** ✅ All models successfully trained and stored in database

#### Expected Failures (Normal Behavior)
- **CNN Models**: Insufficient data (need 61 samples, got 45-46)
- **GRU Models**: Insufficient data (need 31 samples, got 22)
- **Reason**: Historical data accumulation in progress
- **Action**: Models will train automatically as more data becomes available

  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY prediction_type;
```

### Results
| Prediction Type | Total | Last Generated |
|----------------|-------|----------------|
