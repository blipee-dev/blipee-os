# Multi-Tenant Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the multi-tenant architecture implementation for Blipee OS, enabling organizations to manage multiple buildings with role-based access control and personalized AI interactions.

## Core Concepts

### Tenant Hierarchy
```
Organization (Company)
├── Buildings (Sites)
│   ├── Zones/Areas
│   └── Systems (HVAC, Lighting, etc.)
└── Users
    ├── Organization Roles
    └── Building Assignments
```

### Data Isolation Strategy
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: PostgreSQL policies ensure data isolation
- **Organization Scoping**: All queries filtered by organization_id
- **Building-Level Permissions**: Granular access control per building
- **API-Level Enforcement**: Double verification at API layer

## Database Design

### Key Tables
1. **organizations**: Company/account level data
2. **buildings**: Physical locations
3. **user_profiles**: Extended user information
4. **organization_members**: User-organization relationships
5. **building_assignments**: User-building permissions

### Security Model
- Every table includes organization_id for isolation
- RLS policies prevent cross-tenant data access
- JWT tokens include organization context
- API validates permissions on every request

## User Roles

### Organization Level
- **Subscription Owner**: Full control, billing access
- **Organization Admin**: Manage all buildings and users

### Building Level
- **Site Manager**: Full building control
- **Facility Manager**: Day-to-day operations
- **Technician**: Maintenance and repairs
- **Group Manager**: Department/area control
- **Tenant**: Basic user access

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Database schema with RLS
- Basic authentication
- Organization management

### Phase 2: User Management (Weeks 3-4)
- Invitation system
- Role assignment
- Permission engine

### Phase 3: Onboarding (Weeks 5-6)
- 7-minute setup flow
- Smart defaults
- Progressive disclosure

### Phase 4: AI Integration (Weeks 7-8)
- Role-based personalities
- Context awareness
- Smart recommendations

### Phase 5: Production (Weeks 9-10)
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Migration tools

## Security Considerations
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with SOC2, GDPR, CCPA
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Performance Goals
- Sub-200ms API response times
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- Efficient query patterns with proper indexing
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
