- AI API calls: 15% of requests (85% reduction)

## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### Starting the Performance Stack

```bash
# Start Redis and monitoring
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations for indexes
npx supabase migration up

# Build with optimization
npm run build

# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze
npm run optimize
```

### Monitoring Performance

1. **Real-time Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/settings/performance
2. **Redis Commander**: http://localhost:8081
3. **Metrics API**: GET /api/monitoring/metrics

### Running Load Tests

```bash
# Quick smoke test
./scripts/load-test.sh
# Select option 1

# Full load test
k6 run tests/load/k6-config.js

# Performance benchmarks
npm test tests/benchmarks/performance.test.ts
```

### Cache Management

```bash
# Warm cache with common queries
npx ts-node scripts/warm-cache.ts

# Clear cache via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/monitoring/performance \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "clear_cache"}'
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-password

# Database Pooling
PGBOUNCER_HOST=localhost
PGBOUNCER_PORT=6432
SUPABASE_READ_REPLICA_URLS=url1,url2

# CDN
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL=https://cdn.blipee.com
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-token
```

### Cache Strategies
