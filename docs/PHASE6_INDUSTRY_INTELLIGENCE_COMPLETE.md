const networkJoin = await benchmarkingEngine.joinNetwork(profile, {
  anonymizationLevel: 'advanced',
  dataAggregationThreshold: 5,
  sensitivityClassification: 'business_sensitive',
  consentLevel: 'explicit'
});
```

#### Supply Chain Network Analysis
```typescript
// Complete network mapping with risk assessment
const supplyNetwork = await supplyChainEngine.buildNetworkMap(
  organizationId,
  suppliers,
  customers
);
// Provides: risk clusters, resilience scores, cascade effects
```

#### Regulatory Predictive Analytics
```typescript
// AI-powered regulatory foresight
const regulatoryIntelligence = await regulatoryEngine.generateRegulatoryIntelligence(
  organizationId,
  industry,
  jurisdictions,
  businessActivities
);
// Returns: upcoming regulations, compliance gaps, strategic recommendations
```
