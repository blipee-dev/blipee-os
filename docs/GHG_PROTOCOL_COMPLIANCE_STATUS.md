# GHG Protocol Compliance Status

## Current Status: PARTIALLY COMPLIANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

While we have substantial emissions data (10,832 records), we're missing several key elements required for full GHG Protocol compliance.

## What We Have ‚úÖ

### Scope 1 (Direct Emissions)
- ‚úÖ **Mobile Combustion**: Company vehicles
- ‚úÖ **Fugitive Emissions**: Refrigerant leaks (R410a)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Stationary Combustion**: Only partial (natural gas, diesel generators inserted but not showing in queries)
- ‚ùå **Process Emissions**: Data inserted but not retrievable

### Scope 2 (Energy Indirect)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Purchased Electricity**: Data exists but not showing correctly
- ‚ùå **Purchased Steam**: Not showing
- ‚ùå **Purchased Heating**: Missing
- ‚ùå **Purchased Cooling**: Not showing

### Scope 3 (Value Chain)
- ‚ùå **0 of 15 categories** properly tracked
- Business travel, employee commuting, waste, and others were inserted but aren't queryable

### Water & Waste ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Water Sources**: Municipal, recycled, rainwater, groundwater
- ‚úÖ **Waste Types**: General waste, recyclables (limited variety)

## What's Missing for Full Compliance ‚ùå

### 1. **Scope 2 Dual Reporting**
- Need BOTH location-based AND market-based methods
- Currently only have location-based calculations

### 2. **Organizational Boundaries**
- Must define: Equity share, Financial control, or Operational control
- Not currently stored in organization settings

### 3. **All Kyoto Protocol GHGs**
- Currently tracking: CO‚ÇÇ (as CO‚ÇÇe), some HFCs
- Missing separate tracking of: CH‚ÇÑ, N‚ÇÇO, PFCs, SF‚ÇÜ, NF‚ÇÉ

### 4. **Scope 3 Categories (0/15 implemented)**
Need to properly implement:
1. Purchased Goods & Services
2. Capital Goods  
3. Fuel & Energy Activities
4. Upstream Transportation
5. Waste Generated
6. Business Travel
7. Employee Commuting
8. Upstream Leased Assets
9. Downstream Transportation
10. Processing of Sold Products
11. Use of Sold Products
12. End-of-Life Treatment
13. Downstream Leased Assets
14. Franchises
15. Investments

### 5. **GWP Values Documentation**
- Need to specify which IPCC Assessment Report GWP values are used
- Should use AR5 or AR6 values

### 6. **Verification & Assurance**
- No external verification capability
- No audit trail for changes

## Database Issues Found üêõ

The comprehensive emissions data was inserted (9,284 records) but queries are only returning a subset. This suggests:
1. Data insertion was successful but there may be RLS (Row Level Security) issues
2. The category names might not match exactly what queries expect
3. There could be data integrity issues

## Recommendations for Full Compliance üìã

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix data retrieval** - Debug why inserted Scope 2 & 3 data isn't showing
2. **Add market-based calculations** for Scope 2
3. **Define organizational boundary** in organization settings
4. **Implement Scope 3 tracking** for all 15 categories

### Medium-term Actions:
1. **Separate GHG tracking** - Track CH‚ÇÑ, N‚ÇÇO, etc. separately
2. **Add GWP values table** with IPCC AR5/AR6 references
3. **Implement verification module** for external assurance
4. **Create materiality assessment** for Scope 3 categories

### Database Schema Additions Needed:
```sql
-- Organizational boundaries
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN boundary_approach VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN base_year INTEGER;

-- GHG-specific tracking
ALTER TABLE emissions_data ADD COLUMN ghg_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'CO2';
ALTER TABLE emissions_data ADD COLUMN gwp_value DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE emissions_data ADD COLUMN gwp_source VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'IPCC_AR5';

-- Verification
CREATE TABLE emission_verifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  emission_data_id UUID REFERENCES emissions_data(id),
  verification_status VARCHAR(50),
  verifier_name VARCHAR(255),
  verification_date DATE,
  assurance_level VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## Summary

**Current Compliance Level: ~40%**

We have the foundation but need significant work to achieve full GHG Protocol compliance. The main gaps are:
- Scope 3 implementation (biggest gap)
- Dual Scope 2 reporting
- Separate GHG tracking
- Organizational boundaries definition
- Verification capability

The good news is that our database structure can support full compliance with some additions and fixes to data retrieval.
