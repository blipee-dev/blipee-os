# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Implementation

## âœ… Complete - Ready to Test!

We've successfully implemented **Supabase's built-in MFA** system for your application. This replaces the custom MFA implementation with Supabase's native, production-ready solution.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Implemented

### 1. **MFA Enrollment Component** âœ…
**File:** `src/components/auth/MFAEnrollment.tsx`

Features:
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Manual secret key entry option (for apps that can't scan QR)
- 6-digit code verification
- Copy-to-clipboard for secret key
- Friendly setup flow with clear instructions
- Error handling and user feedback

Usage:
```tsx
<MFAEnrollment
  onSuccess={() => console.log('MFA enabled!')}
  onCancel={() => setEnrolling(false)}
/>
```

### 2. **MFA Challenge Component** âœ…
**Files:**
- `src/components/auth/MFAChallenge.tsx` (new, advanced version)
- `src/components/auth/mfa/MFAVerification.tsx` (updated to use Supabase)

Features:
- Auto-focus 6-digit code input
- Auto-submit when all digits entered
- Paste support for 6-digit codes
- Arrow key navigation between digits
- Error handling with retry
- Clean, user-friendly UI

### 3. **Updated Signin Flow** âœ…
**File:** `src/app/api/auth/signin/route.ts`

Changes:
- Checks Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) after password signin
- Detects if user has MFA factors enrolled
- Creates MFA challenge automatically
- Returns `requiresMFA`, `factorId`, and `challengeId` to frontend

Flow:
```
1. User enters email + password
2. Password validated (AAL1 achieved)
3. Check if user has MFA enrolled
4. If yes: Create challenge, show MFA prompt
5. If no: Complete signin normally
```

### 4. **MFA Settings Page** âœ…
**File:** `src/app/settings/security/mfa/page.tsx`

Features:
- View MFA status (enabled/disabled)
- Enroll in MFA with guided flow
- List all enrolled MFA factors
- Disable MFA with confirmation
- Information about MFA benefits
- Beautiful, consistent UI with glass morphism

Access: Navigate to `/settings/security/mfa`

### 5. **Signin Page Updates** âœ…
**File:** `src/app/signin/page.tsx`

Changes:
- Added `factorId` state
- Passes both `factorId` and `challengeId` to MFAVerification
- Handles MFA challenge flow seamlessly
- Maintains existing SSO and OAuth flows

## ðŸ”’ How It Works

### Enrollment Flow
```
1. User navigates to /settings/security/mfa
2. Clicks "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
3. System calls supabase.auth.mfa.enroll()
4. QR code generated and displayed
5. User scans QR with authenticator app
6. User enters 6-digit code to verify
7. System calls supabase.auth.mfa.challengeAndVerify()
8. MFA enabled! âœ…
```

### Login Flow (MFA Enabled)
```
1. User enters email + password
2. Backend validates credentials (AAL1)
3. Backend checks: user.aal === 'aal1' && factors.length > 0
4. Backend creates challenge: supabase.auth.mfa.challenge()
5. Returns requiresMFA: true, factorId, challengeId
6. Frontend shows MFA challenge component
7. User enters 6-digit code from app
8. System calls supabase.auth.mfa.verify()
9. Login complete with AAL2! âœ…
```

### Disable Flow
```
1. User navigates to /settings/security/mfa
2. Clicks "Disable" on enrolled factor
3. Confirmation dialog shown
4. System calls supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({ factorId })
5. MFA disabled âœ…
```

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies Added

```bash
npm install qrcode.react
```

This package is used to generate QR codes for authenticator apps.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Supabase MFA APIs Used

1. **Enrollment:**
   ```typescript
   supabase.auth.mfa.enroll({
     factorType: 'totp',
     friendlyName: 'Authenticator App'
   })
   ```

2. **Challenge Creation:**
   ```typescript
   supabase.auth.mfa.challenge({
     factorId: 'factor-uuid'
   })
   ```

3. **Code Verification:**
   ```typescript
   supabase.auth.mfa.verify({
     factorId: 'factor-uuid',
     challengeId: 'challenge-uuid',
     code: '123456'
   })
   ```

4. **List Factors:**
   ```typescript
   supabase.auth.mfa.listFactors()
   ```

5. **Unenroll:**
   ```typescript
   supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({
     factorId: 'factor-uuid'
   })
   ```

### Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL)

- **AAL1:** User authenticated with password only
- **AAL2:** User authenticated with password + MFA

Check current AAL:
```typescript
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
console.log(session.user.aal); // 'aal1' or 'aal2'
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Enable MFA
- [ ] Navigate to `/settings/security/mfa`
- [ ] Click "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
- [ ] Scan QR code with Google Authenticator / Authy
- [ ] Enter 6-digit code from app
- [ ] Verify "Status: Enabled" shows
- [ ] Verify factor appears in "Enrolled Methods"

### Test 2: Sign In with MFA
- [ ] Sign out completely
- [ ] Navigate to `/signin`
- [ ] Enter email + password
- [ ] Verify MFA challenge screen appears
- [ ] Enter incorrect code â†’ should show error
- [ ] Enter correct code from authenticator app
- [ ] Verify successful signin to dashboard

### Test 3: Disable MFA
- [ ] Navigate to `/settings/security/mfa`
- [ ] Click "Disable" on enrolled factor
- [ ] Confirm in dialog
- [ ] Verify "Status: Disabled" shows
- [ ] Sign out and sign in again
- [ ] Verify NO MFA prompt (direct to dashboard)

### Test 4: Edge Cases
- [ ] Try to enable MFA twice (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Test "Cancel" during enrollment
- [ ] Test "Back to Sign In" during MFA challenge
- [ ] Test paste 6-digit code in MFA challenge
- [ ] Test hard refresh during MFA challenge

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Test the Implementation:**
   - Run through the testing checklist above
   - Verify all flows work as expected

2. **Optional: Remove Custom MFA Table (Future):**
   - The `user_mfa_config` table is now redundant
   - Can be removed in a future cleanup PR
   - Supabase stores MFA factors in its own tables

3. **Optional: Add Recovery Codes (Enhancement):**
   - Generate backup codes during enrollment
   - Allow users to use backup codes if they lose their phone
   - Store backup codes securely (hashed)

4. **Optional: Remember Device (Enhancement):**
   - Implement "Trust this device for 30 days" feature
   - Use Supabase's AAL refresh tokens
   - Reduce MFA prompts for trusted devices

5. **User Communication:**
   - Announce MFA availability to users
   - Encourage security-conscious users to enable it
   - Update security documentation
