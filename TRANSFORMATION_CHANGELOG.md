## Version History

### [4.0.0] - 2024-03-25 14:30
**Changed By**: Transformation Consultant  
**Approved By**: CTO  
**Trigger**: Comprehensive review revealed missing enterprise requirements  
**Priority**: HIGH  

#### Changes Made:
- Added adaptive tracking and replanning system
- Extended timeline from 22 to 32 weeks
- Added Phases 6-8 for enterprise features
- Introduced real-time tracking dashboard
- Created buffer management system (20% per phase)
- Added daily update requirements

#### Impact:
- **Schedule**: +10 weeks (justified by enterprise requirements)
- **Budget**: +$245K for additional phases
- **Resources**: Need to hire 2 additional engineers
- **Risk**: Reduced overall risk through better tracking

### [3.0.0] - 2024-03-25 10:00
**Changed By**: QA Lead & Technical Writer  
**Approved By**: CTO  
**Trigger**: Lack of quality assurance and documentation processes  
**Priority**: HIGH  

#### Changes Made:
- Added comprehensive QA framework
- Integrated documentation tasks in each phase
